# Would You Rather Project

## Live-url- https://would-you-rather-by-manpreet.netlify.app/

## project rules: https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1567/view

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's React - Redux course. This app a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” questions answer game. In this project, I'm using react and redux functionality, improving the predictability of the application’s state; establish rules for getting and updating the store; and identify what state should live inside of Redux and what state should live inside of React components.

# extra description for api

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the `_DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

- Users
- Questions

### Users
